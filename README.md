# Bubble Sort in C

This project implements the **Bubble Sort algorithm** using the C programming language. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort is a basic algorithm where larger elements "bubble up" to the end of the list with each pass. It’s easy to understand and implement, although it's not efficient for large datasets.

- **Best Case (Already Sorted)**: O(n)
- **Average Case**: O(n²)
- **Worst Case (Reversed List)**: O(n²)

## Features

- Sorts an array of integers in ascending order
- Displays array before and after sorting
- Clear and easy-to-understand implementation

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC (or any standard C compiler)
- **Libraries**: `stdio.h`
